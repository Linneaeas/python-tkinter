Hey! It looks like you're running into a Python version mismatch issue on your Mac.

Here’s what’s going on based on your output:

🧩 Problem Summary:
You installed pygame for Python 3.9, but when you type python3 in the terminal, you're actually running Python 3.8.9 — and pygame is only installed for that one. If your code is trying to run with 3.9, it'll complain that pygame isn’t found because it's not installed for that version.

🔍 What's Happening?
From your terminal:

python3 runs Python 3.8.9

But in /usr/local/bin/, you have Python 3.9 installed, just not set as your default.

If your code (or an IDE) uses /usr/local/bin/python3.9, and pygame isn’t installed in that Python version’s site-packages, the ModuleNotFoundError will happen.

✅ Fix Options
Option 1: Install pygame for Python 3.9
Run this in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
/usr/local/bin/python3.9 -m pip install pygame
Then try running your code again using:

bash
Copy code
/usr/local/bin/python3.9 your_script.py
Option 2: Use Python 3.8 (since pygame is working there)
If you're okay sticking with 3.8, make sure any scripts or your IDE use python3 (which points to 3.8.9).

Option 3: Set Python 3.9 as your default (if preferred)
You can use something like pyenv to manage versions or manually adjust symlinks, but that's a bit more involved — happy to walk you through that if you want!

Want to check where pygame is actually installed? Run this:

bash
Copy code
/usr/local/bin/python3.9 -m pip show pygame
If it says “not found”, then yeah, it’s just not installed for 3.9 yet.

Let me know how you want to proceed!

thank youI I did the first one, it worked for pygame and flask, but not for tkinter.

Ah, yeah — that one’s a little different! 😄

🧩 Why pip install tkinter doesn't work:
tkinter isn't something you install via pip. It's actually part of the standard library, but only if Python was built with Tk support — and sometimes on macOS, it’s missing if Python was installed via Homebrew or built manually.

🧪 Check if tkinter is installed in Python 3.9
Try this:

bash
Copy code
/usr/local/bin/python3.9
Then in the Python prompt:

python
Copy code
import tkinter
tkinter._test()
If it opens a tiny window — you're good!

If you get an error like ModuleNotFoundError, then tkinter isn’t included in your Python 3.9 install.

✅ How to Fix It
You’ll likely need to reinstall Python 3.9 with Tk support. Here’s how:

💡 Option 1: Use the official Python installer (recommended)
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/

Download the macOS 64-bit universal2 installer for Python 3.9

Run the installer — it includes tkinter support out of the box

After installing, check:

bash
Copy code
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3
You can use that to run your script, or update your PATH to point to it.

💡 Option 2: Install with Homebrew + Tcl/Tk (more advanced)
If you really want to stick with Homebrew:

bash
Copy code
brew install python-tk@3.9
But this can be tricky to link correctly, so the official installer is easier and more reliable on macOS for GUI support.

Let me know which route you wanna take and I’ll guide you through it!

thanl you! I get the tiny window when i run the command in the main terminal. 

Python 3.9.22 (main, Apr  9 2025, 09:59:25)

But when i try to run my code in vscose terminal i get

Ahhh okay — good news and weird news:

✅ Good News:
tkinter is working correctly in the version of Python you're launching from the terminal (/usr/local/bin/python3.9). That little window is the official stamp of approval 😄

🤯 Weird News:
That error:

scss
Copy code
macOS 11 (1107) or later required, have instead 11 (1106) !
zsh: abort      python3 demo.py
...is super weird and comes from a mismatch between your Python build and macOS version detection. It looks like your Python was built expecting macOS 11.7 (1107), but your system identifies as 11.6 (1106) — which might happen even on macOS Monterey or Ventura due to SDK quirks or custom builds.

🩹 Fix Options:
✅ Option 1: Explicitly run the Python that works
Instead of just python3 demo.py, run:

bash
Copy code
/usr/local/bin/python3.9 demo.py
This ensures you're using the one that opens the tkinter window successfully.

You can even add an alias in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
alias py39="/usr/local/bin/python3.9"
Then run:

bash
Copy code
py39 demo.py
🛠 Option 2: Tell VSCode to use the correct Python
Open the Command Palette in VSCode: Cmd+Shift+P

Search for Python: Select Interpreter

Choose the one that points to /usr/local/bin/python3.9

You can also check in the .vscode/settings.json of your project:

json
Copy code
{
  "python.pythonPath": "/usr/local/bin/python3.9"
}
⚠️ Bonus Tip: Don’t rely on just python3
The python3 command in your terminal or VSCode might point to a different version (like Python 3.8 or a system version) that doesn’t match the working one.

You can double-check what it points to by running:

bash
Copy code
which python3
Let me know how that goes — or if you want help tweaking VSCode’s config!

thank you! It workes with the usr/local... and i changed the interpreter to the recommended ( the ones that inclide the word local)
but i still have to type the whole thing to make it run
linnea@Linneas-MacBook-Pro python-tkinter % python3 demo.py                 
macOS 11 (1107) or later required, have instead 11 (1106) !
zsh: abort      python3 demo.py
linnea@Linneas-MacBook-Pro python-tkinter % /usr/local/bin/python3.9 demo.py

linnea@Linneas-MacBook-Pro python-tkinter % which python3

/usr/bin/python3

Awesome — you're sooo close now 😄 You're already running things the right way manually, just need to make your terminal default to the right Python.

✅ Goal:
Make it so that when you type python3, it uses /usr/local/bin/python3.9 instead of /usr/bin/python3 (which is the old system one that throws that macOS version error).

🛠️ Option 1: Add an alias to your shell config (easy + safe)
If you're using Zsh (which you are, since you're in zsh), just do this:

bash
Copy code
echo 'alias python3="/usr/local/bin/python3.9"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
Now when you type python3, it'll run Python 3.9 🎉

You can confirm it worked with:

bash
Copy code
which python3
It should now say:

swift
Copy code
/usr/local/bin/python3.9
✨ Bonus: Also alias pip3 (optional)
If you want pip3 to match python3, also add:

bash
Copy code
echo 'alias pip3="/usr/local/bin/python3.9 -m pip"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
Let me know if you want to go fancier (like setting it up with pyenv), but this alias trick is perfect if you just want it to work now without hassle.
